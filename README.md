# E08b-Adding-Tiles

I completed the assignment by adding rows of tiles with different colored sprites and collision shapes overlaying the sprites. Along with the script, it allowed the shapes to disappear when touched by the ball. After adding physics to the ball, the tiles "broke" and we had a simple game of breakout.
